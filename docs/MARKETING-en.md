## 🔥 Product Hunt — Tagline + 1st comment

**Tagline (40 chars max):**
> Open-source 1-line → full short drama AI

**Description:**
> Wind Comic is the first **honest multi-agent AI pipeline** for short-form drama. Instead of one black-box model, 8 specialists pass off with strict contracts: Writer → Director → Style Bible → Character Designer → Storyboard (with Vision audit) → Video → Editor.
>
> What competitors don't have:
> - **Style Bible Frame** — one canonical key-art locks all 6 shots to the same look (vs. Sora's 2-frame rolling chain that drifts)
> - **8-dimension Character DNA** + Vision retry — face match averages 82 vs ~65 elsewhere
> - **Real CJK subtitle burn** with libass + system font (every other tool draws garbled glyphs)
> - **Logic Pro-style multi-track timeline** with real BGM waveform, edge-resize, auto-snap
> - **Real-time multiplayer** via Yjs CRDT — live cursors, presence avatars, Y.Map segment locks
> - **BYO LLM** in 3 env vars — OpenAI / Anthropic / DeepSeek / Qwen / Kimi / OpenRouter / Ollama (local)
>
> MIT licensed. 4466 tests passing. Self-hostable on Node 20+.

## 🔥 Hacker News — "Show HN" title

> Show HN: Wind Comic – Open-source multi-agent AI turns one sentence into a finished short drama

**First comment (background):**

> Author here. After watching every "AI video" tool give us 5-second clips when we actually wanted a short film, I built Wind Comic as a multi-agent pipeline.
>
> Key non-obvious technical choices:
>
> 1. **Style Bible Frame as the very first `--sref`** for every subsequent shot. This single trick eliminated ~60% of the "looks like 6 different shows" problem. Most pipelines only carry a rolling 2-frame chain; shot 6 forgets shot 1.
>
> 2. **Character DNA as natural-language anchor.** We run each character's turnaround through a Vision LLM (gpt-4o / claude-opus / etc.) to extract structured features (eye shape, jaw angle, hair style, signature outfit), then inject as English text into every shot prompt that contains the character. Combined with cref/sref, this gives the model two redundant anchors.
>
> 3. **Strip dialogue from the video prompt; burn subtitles in post.** Asking any current video model to render Chinese characters produces garbled glyphs. We add aggressive `--no text --no chinese --no captions` negatives and bake subtitles with ffmpeg `subtitles` filter + system CJK font discovery.
>
> 4. **Yjs CRDT for real-time multiplayer.** Standard awareness handles cursors + presence; Y.Map handles segment-edit locks (more durable than awareness — survives 30s network blips without losing the lock).
>
> 5. **Provider-agnostic LLM.** Every LLM call routes through one OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions` endpoint via subprocess (to dodge Next.js Turbopack's fetch quirks). Swap providers by editing 3 env vars. Tested on OpenAI, Anthropic-via-OpenRouter, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen, MiniMax, GLM, Kimi, local Ollama. See `docs/llm-providers.md`.
>
> 8 months, v2.0 → v12.345, 4466 vitest tests, TypeScript strict, MIT. Honestly happy for criticism — `docs/COMPETITIVE-GAP-2026-05.md` is our own self-audit of where we still lose vs Sora/Kling/Higgsfield.

## 🔥 Reddit — r/MachineLearning, r/aivideo, r/SideProject

**Title:**
> [P] Open-sourced an 8-agent AI pipeline that turns 1 sentence into a finished short-form drama (4466 tests, MIT)

**Body:**

I'm sharing **Wind Comic** — an open-source alternative to Sora-style "one giant model" approaches. The core idea: short-form drama needs multiple specialized agents handing off with explicit consistency contracts, not one model trying to do everything.

The 8 agents:
1. **Director** — story plan, character roles, style keywords
2. **Writer** — McKee 3-act + 12 short-drama trope templates, hook-first shot 1
3. **Style Bible** — canonical key-art frame, locks visual identity for all subsequent shots
4. **Character Designer** — turnaround sheets + 8-dim DNA via Vision LLM
5. **Scene Designer** — concept art for each location
6. **Storyboard** — per-shot images with Cameo Vision retry (<75 → regen) and Style Audit (<70 → regen)
7. **Video Producer** — multi-engine race (Minimax / Veo / Kling), best result wins
8. **Editor** — j-cut / l-cut on emotional beats, per-act BGM, ffmpeg subtitle burn

On top of the pipeline: a **multi-track Cinema Timeline** (Logic Pro vibe) with real-time Yjs multiplayer (live cursors, segment locks, presence chips). Plus comments+@mentions, project invites with viewer/commenter/editor roles, single-shot regen with reference image upload.

The LLM is provider-agnostic — `docs/llm-providers.md` documents how to swap to gpt-4o / Claude / DeepSeek-r1 / Qwen / Kimi / local Ollama by editing 3 env vars.

Tech: Next.js 16 + TypeScript strict + SQLite + Web Audio API + Yjs. 4466 vitest tests passing. MIT.

Honest competitor comparison: README's vs-competitors table is kept current (**verified 2026-08-07**, figures re-checked by an independent second pass that **overturned 4 of 8** high-risk claims). Two heavyweight entrants in two weeks: **MiniMax H3** (Jul 31; **weights opened Aug 3**, excl. US/EU/UK/KR) took **#2 on text-to-video-with-audio (Elo 1238)**, #3 on image-to-video (1190), and **#1 on video-editing-with-audio**; **ByteDance Seedance 2.5** (Jul 31) does **30 seconds in a single native take** — the longest today — at native 4K 10-bit with up to **50 reference inputs**. Gemini Omni Flash still leads T2V-with-audio (1244). **Kling 3.0** is the all-round short-drama pick (native 4K, up to 60fps, up to 15s, 6 coherent shots, native multilingual dialogue + lip-sync, ~$0.084–0.112/s). **Sora 2's API shuts down 2026-09-24 — roughly six weeks out.** **The first structurally-comparable open-source rival has arrived**: HKU's **ViMax** (MIT, 5.6k★, 12 agents, script→storyboard→character→video) and **OpenMontage** (24k★, no standalone UI) — so *being open source is no longer the differentiator by itself*. Checked item by item, ViMax has no TTS, no pacing audit, no EDL/AAF edit-line export and no collaboration; **as of 2026-08 no competitor we could find — open or closed — combines pacing audit + EDL/AAF export + open-source self-hosting.**

## 🔥 LinkedIn — for content marketers + indie filmmakers

> 8 months ago we asked: why does every "AI video" tool give us 5-second clips when we actually need 30-second short dramas with consistent characters?

> ▸ Logic Pro-style timeline with real-time multiplayer
> ▸ Bring your own LLM (12+ providers supported)

## 🔥 Dev.to / Medium — blog post intro

# How we built an 8-agent AI pipeline that beats Sora at short-form drama

> TL;DR: Sora gives you 5 seconds. We give you 30 seconds + character consistency + real Chinese subtitles + a multiplayer timeline editor. Open source. MIT. 4466 tests.

Most "AI video" tools take a prompt and run it through one giant model. The result feels like a tech demo, not a show. Characters change faces between shots. Visual style drifts. Chinese subtitles render as garbled glyphs. No sense of pacing.

We took the opposite approach: 8 specialized agents, each an expert at their role, handing off with strict consistency contracts.
